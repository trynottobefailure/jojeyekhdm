    <p style="margin-top: 35px;">&nbsp &nbsp once upon a time , 
        a family went to a jungle for a 2 days trip .
        they were a happy family with a lot of chidren. 
        the kids were being kid and messing around , 
        the big brother got tired and decided to sit somewhere 
        and take a quick rest. 
        he found a broken tree and sat there , 
        he realized that something is wrong !</p>

    <p>&nbsp &nbsp he saw some beautiful eggs in a basket 
        in the middle of nowhere . after staring at them for like 2 hours , 
        he finally decided to pick them up . 
        when he came back to the آغوش خانواده 
        his mother asked him worriedly where has he been ?</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp he explained the whole situation , mother called an emergency 
        family meeting to make a decision for the eggs fate, 
        all of them agreed on frying the eggs , but the smallest kid , 
        stole an egg and hid it in his pocket.</p>
    
        <img id="img2" src="img2.jpg">
        <img id="img3" src="img3.jpg">
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp days passed in a blink of an eye and the kid took good care 
        of the stolen egg . he remembered that cloudy day , 
        they were on a trip but the kid was sad and his mood was cloudy
        just like the weather. in that day .. his mother made dinner 
        with those eggs, he tried his best but yet.. failed to forget
        the sound of cracking the poor innocent eggs .. at that night 
        he refused to eat absolutely anything. he was just a child.
        he was just a child! </p>

    <p>&nbsp &nbsp he was looking at his mother frightened an angry like she was 
        an actual murderer. he kept thinking that why those damn
        seconds won't pass and why the freaking eggs won't get fryed.</p>

    <p>&nbsp &nbsp poor child didn't talk to his mommy for two days.
        every one was concern about him and he still refused talking.
        he kept thinking and thinking , over and over , again and again !
        it was late so he finally falled sleep.
        the next morning was an important day cause he had made his decision. 
        he was going to take care of the egg for the rest of his life.</p>

    <p>&nbsp &nbsp they came back to their home . he never said a single word 
        to his parents about what he went through.
        months passed and he kept the egg in a warm and soft place. 
        he kept it under his pillow .. the egg was his friend now ..
        cause he talked to the egg every single night like it was alive,  
        he kissed it and said good night to it every night ..</p>  
        
        <img id="img4" src="img4.jpg">
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp the kid was having good time with his new friend but 
            on a spring day every thing suddenly changed
            he heard cracking sound .. he remembered those cursed days
            when they were on the trip .. he remembered what happend 
            to other eggs .. he was going to cry .. 
            he startet crying. he thought the he is going to lose
            his friend for good. how could he possibebly carry on
            without his bestie .. he was lost in his thoughts that 
            he heard a weird noise. he ignored it. but the noise 
            kept raising up. the kid opened his eye . they were filled with
            tears. the noise was coming from the cracked egg .. -- jik jik, jik jik-- 
            he couldn't trust his eyes , he thought he was hallucinating.
            but it was real. the kid became the happiest person 
            in the entire universe!</p>

        <p>&nbsp &nbsp months kept passing but the kid didn't even realized that.
            he was having the best days of his life 
            now the whole family knew about <b>joje ;)</b>
            he made her a small box next to his bed so he could hear her 
            voice every night before sleep :)</p>

        <img id="img5" src="img5.jpg">
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp the joje was growing up, the kid spends all of his time with her 
            he hugged her every night , یکمم لاس میزد باهاش , it was truely
            the best days of his life.</p> 

        <p>&nbsp &nbsp joje keep growing more and more and he start questioning 
            about his family , the kid didn't know what to say , 
            and he kept saying that she is gonna found out when she 
            growed up an become an adult.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">(isn't she the cutest for real?)</p>

        <p>&nbsp &nbsp by spending so much time with humans, joje bacame an 
            actual human being, she was the cutes little girl -- the 
            kid thought so -- he was gonna miss the -- jik jik -- sound
            , but now he had an actual best friend, he accepted that 
            now she is old enough and she deserve to know the truth about 
            her family.</p>

        <p>&nbsp &nbsp he explained everything to her while he was holding her 
            between his arms and even tho himself was sad about that 
            day that everything happend, he hold back his tears and 
            decided to be there for the joje, she was drowning in her tears
            and the kids hand couldn't clean her tears.</p>

        <p>&nbsp &nbsp joje sleep that night very late, when she woke up, she was still
            in kids arms :) it was a long night for her, it was hard 
            to take all of that sad news at once, she was happy that 
            the kid was there for her ..</p>
